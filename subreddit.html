Title: Is marketing with direct mail worth it?
Description: Hey everyone!

I'm a multifamily investor in NY and there's just such poor inventory, it's becoming increasingly difficult to even find good matches.

I was thinking about trying out BatchLeads and blasting multifamily property owners across my area with direct mail.

Has anyone had any success with direct mail? Is it worth it?
Tag: Marketing
Comment: 95% of what I do is direct mail.  Its worth it, for sure.

1. what size MF are you targeting?  2-30 units or so act similar to SFR when it comes to marketing, above that is a different game.

2. Best lists win - a good, up to date list that is freshly skip traced

3. Consistency is key - If you don't plan to mail consistently for at least 8 months, don't even bother.  The real magic comes with consistency, the snowball rolling downhill for 4+ months.  I still get calls on marketing we sent 2 years ago (we mailed them for 2 years straight).

4. Medium - I switch up the marketing monthly, the message (below) remains consistent in theme, the medium is high quality and hand crafted.  Always addresses the owners personally by name, and mentions the property address I'm inquiring about.  The envelope/packaging is always catchy, I cant measure open rate but I'd bet mine is close to 100% lol.  Handwritten is 90% of what we do as well.

5. Message - clear, concise, call to action, and SELLER BENEFITS.  Nobody cares that you have been investing for XX years and own XX properties... people care what you can do for them and what benefits they will get from working with you.

I saw this quality of MLS inventory in 2015 or so, went off market and never looked back.  Now I can control my own inventory by dialing marketing up or down.
Reply: Can you post some imgur links of your mailers with redacted info? Examples are helpful.

What's your conversion rate? Cost per mailer? Any insight into higher efficacy on one target customer vs another? Age group etc?

Title: Inherited some land in FL 0.11 sq 1hr away from Ft Myers, what do I do with it?
Description: I would love to make money on it without selling it. Do I put up a trailer? Build a tiny home?    

The land is not in an affluent neighborhood and there are lots of lots for sale there.

Anyone made money on something like this without having to sell?
Tag: Single Family Home
Comment: If land is paid off, take a loan out against the land, and use it as a down payment for a construction loan. Build duplex. After construction, convert to 30yr mortgage. Rent both sides of duplex. Refinance and pull your money out. Forget about it until renters call for a leak or a new AC unit.
Reply: You should set part of the rent for future repair and also for property tax.
Reply: Thank you but the land is estimated at $10k so that wouldn’t cover the do for a construction loan I don’t believe
Reply: Where are you getting loans on unimproved land and what are the loan terms like?
Reply: It be cheaper to buy 2 mobile home wind zone 3 and rent those...

People actually seekcput mobike homes in the south due to size/cost ratio.

Yoy csn get way more sq ft from a mobile home rental for cheaper.
Reply: You're assuming it's zoned multi family. My guess is based on location, it's zoned single family. If the property is worth 10k, it's unlikely that would be enough of a down payment for a construction loan with today's building costs.
Comment: Research:
- zoning (mobile home permitted?)
- infrastructure (electricity, water, sewer or septic in place? If not those will be expensive to add.)        
- what are rents in the area for dwellings comparable to what you can afford to build or place?
- what is the actual value of the land? If $10k is the tax appraisal, you can’t go by that.
- what are recent land sales numbers in the area? Tax assessors web site should show those.
- HOA or covenants affecting the property?


That’s a start.

Comment: You could potentially put up a trailer or build a tiny home to rent out. Since the land isn't in a high-end area and there are many lots for sale, renting out a small, functional structure might help you generate income without selling the property.
Comment: I once rented a lady's vacant lot (big corner parcel behind a gas station) there in Ft. Myers as a staging area for a big(ish) utility project.  Granted, the property was in a commercial area and not in a neighborhood so take that into consideration.  Anyway, she had a lot, I had a need to stage big poles and equipment while we built for a couple of months. Solved my need for a short term space to operate out of and gave her enough to cover her annual taxes for the property.  win win for everyone.

Title: What happens when you 1031 out a state with a high cap gains rate like Oregon
Description: I am a about to sell my rental in Portland which is making me very happy to get rid of and was considering a 1031 to another place, but can't make the math work well in Oregon, then consider a vaca rental, but I don't feel like I know enough to take one of those on.  Ultimately I think I am going to pay the cap gains and just stay out of the rental game for now, but was considering the possibility of out of state.  However, I wasn't sure how CAP gains works when you 1031 from a state that has a high cap gain rate to a state with little or no cap gain rate.  Does the state you 1031 from eventually get paid?

Comment: I am 2 years into vacation rentals and did not know a thing.  It is pretty easy.  I had my cleaning lady teach me a lot of things.  She knew what is going on competitively and what customers complain about most.  Basically cleanliness and listing accuracy is all you really need.  Some nice photos and that's close to all you need to know.  Seriously.  I have a 4/2 but tested out doing 2/1 and that was pretty good but I like it best of all just renting one bedroom and one bathroom.  why?  IMHO you make your money on the first bedroom.  The next bedroom doesn't gross that much more as the time to do the laundry and if you have 3 or 4 bedrooms you make it up in damages from normal wear and tear, increased laundry and bed-making costs, and increased trash and a big cleaning fee whereas I turn over the one bedroom fast myself and do not get a lot of complains or whining. There is not much trash and 95% of the time the people clean the place up real well other than the bedroom and bath.   I have no idea why people would rent out a 3 bedroom given the extra trouble, maintenance, potential complaints. and expense unless it was an elegant property and mine is nice but certainly not elegant.

Title: First Investment Property Questions
Description: There is a property that my wife and I are thinking we would like to buy. It is a multifamily unit listed for $895,000. There are four different homes on the lot, each of which already have tenants and the listing says that they are very nice and long term tenants. The listing also says that the gross income from the tenants is around $10,000 per month and the estimated monthly payment would be around $4750.

1. I have heard that buying properties with existing tenants is a bad choice. Is that true?

2. This would be our first real estate investment and $895,000 seems pretty expensive for the first time. It seems like a great deal though right? Or am I being naive here?

3. What would loan options be for this? We both have very good credit scores. We do own our current home, and have about $100,000 in equity. From what I know you can get a cheaper down payment if you live on the property, which we are willing to do. I am employed at a 9-5 job and my wife is self employed and her business havs an LLC. Combined our income is around $110,000.   $895,000 is a pretty large loan to us, but is it reasonable to get that size of loan in our situation?

Thanks for any and all answers
Tag: Multi-Family
Comment: i'm not 100% sure if the bank will count the rental income towards your DTI, but if they don't you're never going to qualify because of DTI. Ask the bank if that's even possible or not and you have your answer.   


also, you're absolutely never going to be able to purchase this property unless you live in it. you'd be needing one of these tenants to move out so you can live on site. the bank will never give you any loan on this unless it's your primary residence.

you'll want to look at a conventional or FHA loan. also, "the listing says" is bullshit. you need to do your own due diligence. call the listing agent and ask for rent rolls and tenant history. you won't get a credit report or anything but you can at least see how long they've been there and their payment history and what the rent actually is. lender might want this information.

your down payment will be large. 100k is not enough to hit 20% down so i would just tell you to do 5% down instead and hold the rest of the cash as reserves in a HYSA for a year or two until you are comfortable with the property. make sure you are setting aside money for capex and repair/maintenance and vacancy costs.

this is a big stretch for you. i would normally tell someone with a 110k combined income that they have 0 business owning something this expensive. if for some reason you had 2 of those rentals not paying rent at a time you'd be in an extremely tight spot. this is not a wise decision. you need to look at things under 500-600 and you need to aim for 20% down so you can get a decent rate and avoid pmi.

it's worth noting that in order for you to make the down payment i'm assuming you'd need the equity on your house. floating two mortgages at once is braindead in your situation which means you'd be doing a purchase contingent on sale of your current home, which i'd guess most 4plex owners are going to laugh at and ignore. it's possible, but don't get your hopes up.
Comment: 1. it CAN be, you are inhereting someone else's vetted (or not) tenant, which most of the time is worse than vetting your own tenant.  Sometimes you get lucky and have amazing tenants that come with the property....  its a gamble.

2.  great deal?  I don't know about that since ts subjective, but looks OK on paper as long as you factor in capex, deferred maintenance, vacancies, etc.

3. Conventional, DSCR
Comment: 1) It depends on what your plan/strategy for your investment is. If the in place tenants are paying market rents and it works with your return targets, then what’s the problem? Would you really rather have an empty building and have to pay commissions on each unit and probably get lower than market rents since there’s a reason it’s vacant?

2) You need to do your own calculations based on your loan and costs of operating to see if it will be a great deal or not. You mention you may live in it, so that’s something to consider too.

3) Talk to your local banks and credit unions, or find a mortgage broker.

Title: Thinking of the future
Description:
We purchased our home in 2017 for $200k and refinanced in 2021 for a 2.75% interest rate. Our current mortgage payment is $1,200. Due to recent comps and upgrades (such as building an office shed and upgrading from 1.5 to 2 full bathrooms), our home is now likely worth around $500k. We’re also adjacent to a hot neighborhood where homes valued at $500k are being torn down for multi-million dollar mansions. Homes rent for about 2700 on our street.

We love our home but find it too small, especially now that we both work from home and have a baby and huge dog. It’s also on a very busy road, so it’s def not quiet.

Given this, we’re wondering if it makes sense to sell our current home to buy a new one, or if we should consider managing two mortgages and renting the house out. I’m thinking we wouldn’t do anything until next year or the year after. Our combined income is nearly $200k, and we have money in savings. A new home that’s at least halfway decent will cost us 450k to 550k. We tend to be cautious, so we’re finding it difficult to decide how we want to plan for the future.

Comment: You have answered your own question. Keep that asset and rent it out. That asset will pay you at least $1000 a month above them making the mortgage and paying a company to keep it rented.
Reply: The interest rates are expected to drop in the near future. If you made the new purchase and short term leased out the old home makes you a real estate professional. Bonus depreciation before the end of the year. Next year get a company to rent out and manage for you.
Comment: Keep the house and rent it out. No reason to ever sell properties tied up by low rate debt that cashflow positive.
Reply: We’re pretty new to this—like at what point do the numbers not make sense? Like if we can only make 300 bucks a month after paying the mortgage? Is there a general number we should hope to aim for?
Reply: Plus after a certain time the asset becomes a rental for tax purposes, I think 2 years but Google it. At that point you can sell in a 1031 tax free if you wanted a different rental paying even better yield.
Comment: Yeah doesn’t make sense to sell that. You can net 1500$ a month off the rental, plus if rented you can buy a second home

Comment: You're talking about capital gains tax exemption.

The short version is no; you're not going to go off a tax cliff with your set of facts if you rent this home out for a year before selling.

IRS rules to get the capital gains exemption is that you lived in it for 2 of the last 5 years, which would still be the case if you rented it for the next year.

You will owe income tax on the rental income, and have some depreciation recapture to contend with.

Title: Is it common for renovated and cash flowing rentals sell for below pre-listing appraisal?
Description: I'm selling a duplex that I've fully renovated over the last two years. All the big ticket items have been replaced so the new owner will cash flow even better at 7.4% Cap Rate roughly.

We just got the pre-listing appraisal at 360k which I want to list it at. My agent thinks we should accept offers at or below 360k and offer up to 10k in concessions to buy down the buyer's interest rate or pay their closing costs to incentivize buyers.

I'm fine with more time on market so why not list it at 360k and no concessions or 370k and 10k concessions? I am offering to pay buyer's agent's commission as well.

I understand we're not in 2020 but why sell for below what it's worth when it's turn key and cash flowing well?

Tag: Discussion
Comment: Your agent gets paid the effects the same if your sale price is 360 or 370. Getting a quick sale 10k below appraisal would be way less work for them than dealing with time on market to get you a better price.     
Comment: Depends on market. In my market chicago under $500k we can usually get over or at ask but the $800k+ range is hard to sell right now and often going below ask. We rarely buy down rates, have only seen that on some overpriced listings that they end up never selling.

Tag: Self-Directed/Retirement Investing
Comment: I lived in that country for a year.

It's an autocratic monarchy. Let's skip our political opinions on that. What we care about, as a potential property owner, among other things, is the rule of law and stability.

The UAE has the oil money and the autocratic monarchy seems stable, that's great. And let's suppose that oil money ain't going anywhere any time soon too, awesome, great, done with that.

This isn't the benign monarchy of the UK. The sheikh could get a worm up his ass tomorrow and decide to limit the basket of rights that foreign or non-arab property owners get. And before you suggest that such an explicitly racist policy would never happen, be aware that when an arab citizen marries a woman who is a fellow arab (at least as of \~15 years ago when I was there), the head of state (sheikh, monarch, autocrat, whatever you want to call it) personally gifts them a marital house to live in, for keeping the bloodline pure (I can't remember if this was national, or just in the one Emirate I was in, which was Abu Dhabi, not Dubai... the monarch of Abu Dhabi is the same preson as the autocrat of the country, like how the Brit monarch holds multiple hereditary titles, and the deal the King of England gives may sometimes differ from the rules the King of Scotland hands down, even though the same person is king of both). So race-based public policy as it intersects with real estate isn't a theoretical future possibility, it's ***current events***.

Oh, and the non-arab south asian laborers are essentially indentured servants - the worker had responded to an ad in India for a maid, they show up, their 'boss' takes their passport away, and it's debt bondage to get it back (these people don't have $, but they still have to pay back their 'employer' for the visa and the flight, and what they do have to pay them back with... is work/labor, and that's the price of getting your passport back). Oh, and btw, she isn't going to be a maid, she's goign to be doing, ah, a different type of work. But she's not an arab, so the gov't isn't really going to look too hard at any of this.

Let's go back in time further, when 2008 happened and things were rough, foreigners were so scared shitless about what was going to happen that they drove to the airport, abandoned their brand new luxury cars at the long-term parking lot, and flet the country, leaving all assets behind, with the understanding (that in some cases was true, and in some cases wasn't) that they were abandoning all claims to any real estate they owned as well. Obviously something caused those people to be so scared shitless of the consequences of not paying their debts, no? (keep in mind that if you borrowed money with interest attached, you are ***already*** a sinner in the eyes of the autocracy).

Google exists, and now that you have an idea of what to google search, you should be able to do your own DD on some of the shit to watch out for, and to validate/refute the claims I made for yourself. GL.

That being said, if you're getting an amazing price/value, we all know that ANYTHING can be a good deal... at the right price. So I guess my only suggestion would be to make sure you're getting a price that reflects the risk premium. As a human that presumably cares about human rights, I'd avoid touching anything that's presented as "housing for migrant workers," becuase there's a VERY good chance you're about to get into the human trafficing business, if that's the case, and if Australia is anything like the US, that might be the sort of thing that's a crime for you even if you're doing it overseas.

And, yeah, go get your ass out there in person before pulling any triggers, regardless.

Title: Advise / criticism on my first rental plan
Description: In feb 2022 I bought a condo in downtown Richmond, VA. My rate is 4.875. Paid 186000 and put 25000 down. I owe about 155000 on it now.

In those two years the market has boomed here and my Zillow estimate is now around 260000. I've done some improvements to the property as I have lived here as my primary since I bought it. Small things like kitchen backsplash, on-line water heater, paint, ect.

I'm planning on moving in with my fiancee and moving my condo over to an investment property. I'll rent it fully furnished to traveling medical professionals 6month minimum lease since Its walkable distance to the Hospital.

I believe I can rent it out at 2000-2300 a month. Fully furnished and all utilities included. My monthly cost for the condo is 1610, mortgage, HOA, insurance, Internet and electric (water is with HOA)

Taking taxes into account, after deductions would be about 550-680. This leaves just about a net zero or slightly negative income after Prop Management, and the unexpected.

I make decent money in my career and can afford to have short vacancies here and there.

Should I refinance when the rates drop back down so I can bring in more profit?
Should I sell it and take the funds to buy a duplex? (I hate HOAs after having this condo)
Should I take out a HELOC to purchase another rental to offset this one?

My credit is good, my income is good, and my living situation with my fiancee is about to be half the month cost of where I am at currently. We plan to buy a house together in the next 2 years so we'll be saving for a new primary residence as well.

I'll answer whatever questions needed to give anyone a better picture of my situation for some good advice.    

Thanks.
Tag: Rent or Sell my House?
Comment: Good luck on your journey.

You have a lot of questions and good intentions, but so far, a mess in your head. A chaos.

A few things first.

1. You have no control over interest rates. Do not hope they will come down. Especially below 3.5% for primary and 4.5% for investment properties. If they do, good. Obviously refinance.

 2. Monthly rent for STR and MTR rentals should be much higher than long term rent.

In any market, a $250K condo should rent for $1600-2000 easily.

So I would rather rent it long term for $2000 than to a nurse for $2300. At least get 1.5-1.7X regular rent or why bother?

3. Taxes. If you have no profit, you have no taxes. You pay tax on profit, not on revenue.

4. Calculate total return. Ignore cash flow freaks.

You have X equity now.

If cash flow is 0, what about average 2.5-3% appreciation plus loan paydown? Then maybe you have a huge return?


Plus, if you sell, you lose 7-8% to closing costs which is 20-30% of your equity.

Happy to answer more questions.
Reply: Haha you are not wrong. My head is a mess. Just seems like every thought on this has so many moving parts or different directions to consider. I appreciate you taking the time to answer!

1. I guess I was under the impression that my mortgage payment is not tax deductible therefore considered profit when a tenant is paying it? Am I wrong here?

2. When you say total return, you mean big picture I assume? Long term growth in the property?
Selling it is the last thing I'd want to do because of the area I'm in. New apartments are being built everywhere, shops and restaurants are changing for the better. Etc. I think the condo will continue to do well regardless of the market. But like you said that is out of my control.

>You have X equity now.

>If cash flow is 0, what about average 2.5-3% appreciation plus loan paydown? Then maybe you have a huge return

Could you explain this like you're talking to a guy with a chaotic noob brain? Haha
Comment: Another thing to consider, and this varies per state, but what sort or property tax increase will you incur changing from primary to investment?

I ask because here in South Carolina it basically doubles the payment. Current primary residence I pay around 3k tax a year, switch to investment looking at approx 6k a year.


Good luck!
Reply: Thanks! I will look into this
Comment: If I were you I would study the depreciation you will be able to get on the condo.  You can fully depreciate a condo....not so with a house.  All things being equal condos beat the heck out of houses for depreciation.  If you want to shelter taxes here is the general idea:  price of condo divided by 27.5 years= annual depreciation you get.  Enjoy!

The interest rates are not that bad.  When I bought my first home it was like 12%!!!!
Reply: Woah, the depreciation tax is a GAME CHANGER if I'm understanding it correctly.
That basically evens everything out enough to actually turn a small 200 per month profit.

I will continue to study and ask tax pros about this to be sure I'm on the right path in my calculations.      

Thank you sir!
Comment: These are the questions all property owners ask - what it comes down to is what are you comfortable with? If you can afford to not have cash flow but expect it to appreciate, then do it! If it is a place you want to hold on to because you might want to live there again later, then do it! Alternately, if you are concerned the HOA might have a dramatic increase or outlaw rentals, then it might be better to sell and buy a place you have more control over. The best investors are the ones who feel passionate about where they focus their time and money. Personally, I don’t like condos so don’t buy them, but I know very successful investors who only buy HOA properties - it really depends on how you want to use the property and in what way you want to be involved in it’s maintenance. Best of luck!
Reply: I do want to hold on to it. I have a growing feeling that this place will double in value eventually and I bought it specifically for an investment. It's in a location that I have already received a Purchase offer in the mail. It was the last sub-200k condo in Richmond when I bought it 2 years ago and it's in an area that's close to downtown but still in need of some gentrification. Which has started big time since I've moved in.    
I will never buy another condo but I think I will hold on to this one.

Thank you for your response!
Comment: Do mot sell and continue to build wealth.
Reply: I am leaning this way. I bought it to hold on to and as an investment. I only needed to ask to see if it was a better option. I agree, I do not think it is.
I will hold on to it and watch it grow in value.

Land is worth about $70-80K and houses are worth the rest.

Typical tax rate is about 1% a year. So $2-3K per lot.

I have an opportunity to buy a lot adjacent to a property I own for a lot less than its value. $30K or so.     

I would like to own it for many reasons, from preventing someone else from having it to potentially developing in the future as the area is improving rapidly.

But, I noticed the owner has been paying awful taxes for years. They charge the same $2-3K a year, which will be 10% of purchase price a year!


How could I try to decrease the holding cost? Get some abatement?

Do you guys have any experience with this?

Comment: Depending on your area, consolidating the two tax parcels into one can reduce taxes if it's owner occupied.  This can also reduce some assessments that are charged per parcel.
Comment: There’s not a lot you can do but appeal the taxes every year.  If you’re buying at $30k and it’s an arms length transaction, that’s likely the market value of the lot, so you’d have an argument to be made you should be assessed on that value.


1% of $30,000 is only $300 so not sure how you’re getting to $3,000
Reply: Correct about market value and correct about the math.

But current owner has been paying nearly $3,000 a year in tax.

I mean I own a building next to this lot and it’s identical lot PLUS home in good shape with an identical tax bill.
Comment: You could look into tax exemptions as one option.  For example, some locations will allow agricultural use exemptions.  This all varies from location to location.
Reply: Thank you!

Could you please share more applicable uses/exemptions?

This is a normal suburban lot. Single family zoning, no agricultural use.
Comment: Call your local taxing authority and have a conversation about this. They are ultimately the only ones who can do anything about your tax rates.
Comment: You aren’t able to protest the assessment with the city? You purchasing it for 30K should bring the assessment down a bit so you’re only taxed on it at least for a few years since that’s the price is last sold for.
Reply: It hasn’t been easy.

My point is that once I buy it, I am stuck paying this huge tax so I want to make sure I can solve this problem.
Comment: Make sure not to let anybody talk us into a widespread *increase* in the holding cost of vacant land, lest we accidentally make housing affordable and small businesses viable, and generally heal the economy.      

It is *SO* important that you have the right to exert your capital advantage in the hoarding of natural resources over those with less capital who might otherwise utilize them for some actual economic or social good.      
Comment: In some states land is taxed at a higher rate than buildings, in order to encourage development and discourage land speculation.  Perhaps you're in one of those?
Reply: Oh, not at all. We have so many cheap houses.
Comment: You would need to look at the property tax breakdown. There are probably city/school bonds and other levies that are assessed in addition to the 1% which is driving up the tax. Also, some assessments are done per lot regardless of value.

I’m not sure how it works in your location but when you buy a property in my state the property is reassessed for the value you paid so if the prior assessed value is $80k and you buy it for $30k the property value is reassessed at $30k and that is the new basis for property tax.  You can call your tax collector and assessors office for more information.
Reply: Yes, so basically here’s how it works in our state and county.

Every property is valued and then assessed.

Value $200K.

Assessment 10% of value. $20K.

Tax is X of assessment.

There’s no specific levies or fees.

Title: Best lenders for HELOCs on rental property
Description: Looking into taking out a HELOC on our rental property and was curious if there are any lenders that offer favorable terms. We have our mortgage through BofA and they shared that they would allow for up to 60% combined LTV or max $250k (for the HELOC), whichever is less, based on an approved application.


Any lenders that might offer more favorable CLTV?

Comment: Check a local credit union. I was offered 80% LTV by mine.

Title: Old Single family home debating to sell, Strategy advice.
Description: Houston, TX. This my first property single family home I purchased in 2022 at good 4% mortgage rate. 292K after closing costs. 4bed 3bath, 3 living dens. 2700sqft. Not in flood zone, Tier B neighborhood.      

Lived and rented rooms for 2yrs till date. Now recently closed on a brand new home, without need to sell current home.

Old home is build old with every less renovations.
So far I have only upgraded 1bath and repainted only other baths.
To sell as is market price and appraisal support only 305k
Agents who showed up says comps running around 340k with inside dwelling completely painted he can start the MLS at 348k
If whole renovated will go higher than 400K. Last recent Feb to May fully remodeled house sold for 420K.       

Estimates so far from contractors for painting insides 16K.
Roof older than 15yrs - 16K, which will have 30yr warranty transferable 1time to new owners.
Electrical upgrades - old aluminum to new codes 8k
Plumbing upgrades- old pipes behind sheet rock - 9k
All floor LVP/carpets upgrades-  12k
Kitchen remodeling- cabinets, appliances - 24k
Windows/siding upgrades - 6k
Fence and outdoor makeover- 3K
Garage door/garage walls and waterproofing - 5k

I'm roughly at 95K upgrades costs to make it work for 420K. Which is a breakeven strategy , however the cash would be stuck, could cash out refinance like BRRR, however high risk , with minimal rewards!!

Rental value is only 2400$/month. Which still needs a basic 30K upgrades like painting , roof repairs, bath Toilets,  cleaning up, etc.

I have appetite to sit on it for 6months without renters , however it's not a good deal as annual cash flow would be only 4500$

Cash to sell offers so far at not above 276K. Which kills me for a loss to sell.

What would be the best advice???
I'm attached to property being my first and has potential to grow equity in next 10yrs. My HOA costs is 550 a year. And not a big deal compared to several jn houston. Maintenance costs roughly 1-2% , but the hurricane, storms are making it hard. Trees in property make it difficult to keep renter manageable.
Any two sense could help.
Thank you in advance.

Title: Contractor placed last minute lein on my house as we are set to close! 
Description: So a contractor who has a check in transit to him by me decided to file a lein on my house today that is being sold/closed on monday. Title work is done already and I have signed all that is left is for the buyer to sign and bring the cashiers check to title.

My question is will this last minute lien impact my closing? Can the county stop the recording of the transaction from going thru? Has anyone had any experiance with something like this?

The dumb contractor did not even contact me with a notice to pay or anything. The check got delayed in the mail due to the holiday. I am hoping this does not screw up my sale as this has been a tough house to sell. Any advice?
Tag: Single Family Home
Comment: "The dumb contractor," says the moron who risked closing by sending a check snail mail over a holiday.... 


I'm going to guess that there is a whole lot more to this story.
Reply: How much you wanna bet they were planning on using funds from closing to pay the contractor?
Reply: Right!? I occasionally do contracting for others and have dozens of buddies in the industry. Nobody is going through filing a lien unless it’s been many many weeks without being paid.

Also this has a blatantly easy solution. Just pay the lien, call your bank and cancel the check. Problem solved. It sounds like OP is one of those people who “forgets” to pay their subcontractors. Do that as an investor in my local area and in about 6 months word will get around and nobody will take on your projects.
Reply: And checks take upto 5 business days to clear. My friend doesn't start work until the check clears when he does rehad work.
Reply: Yep.  Closing is coming up but I'm going to pay by check through snail mail.
Comment: So there wouldn't be a lien on the house except the one day Labor Day Monday caused the check in the mail to be late? Sorry, that's not a believable story. You must be months late paying the guy.
Comment: Here's an idea, pay your bills like a decent human being. How long have you been trying to avoid paying? You try to make it sound like you are only a day behind on payment because of the mail and I 100% guarantee that isn't true. No contractor is placing a lien over a 1 day late payment.
Comment: There must be more to the story.  It would be interesting to get the contractor’s side....It generally takes time for someone to get to the point of taking the time and expense to file a lien.   With the instant pay services like a credit card, PayPal, Cashap, Zelle.     The old check is in the mail excuse doesn’t hold much water anymore.  And a first class letter goes across the country within 3 days, local within 2 business days max.      Anyway....

If the title search was done already, the closing attorney may or may not catch the lien last minute.  But you need to notify everyone at the closing regardless, because in the normal course of the pile of paperwork you will sign, you are signing that you are providing clear title and there are no liens.    The best course of action would be to get with the contractor, pay them and get a signed notarized lien release document showing they have been paid to present at closing.  Then the closing attorney can make sure the lien is cancelled/satisfied. 
Reply: Yeah, I follow you on everything but the 3-day thing. I do the deposits for my company and dont even start worrying about a missing check until it passes the 3-week mark. I then let the client know that they will need to stop payment and reissue in a week erso if I dont recieve it.
Reply: If they have my mail person it can take 60 days ya or more for mail to go 5 miles. My water and power have been 60 days before mail was delivered. And I don’t live in BFE my water co is 1 mile from my house lol     
Comment: Pay your bills
Comment: Most states have a timeline that a contractor has to file a lien, if they do not do this within that timeframe, they have no ability to do so.

Also, make sure this wasn’t just a “notice to owner”.

I don’t why one would file for a lien if the payment wasn’t already overdue. This isn’t a free process.        
Comment: Looks like you are in CA. [Are you telling me a contractor spent hundreds of $$$ t](https://www.easylawinc.com/pricing)o file a lien over a day or two late check? Doesn't hold water.
Reply: Cough cough *bullsh\*t*
Comment: >*The dumb contractor did not even contact me with a notice to pay or anything.*

Did you think the contractor was working for free? When the work is done, you pay for the services. Immediately. I'm having a hard time believing that they filed a lien on your house simply because the mail was delayed **2-3 days** for the holiday.

To be real, if you're the one with the lien on the house, then I don't think the contractor is the dumb one in this situation. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong though. This forum is a the perfect place to discuss contractor horror stories, and I'm sure we could all learn something if this contractor actually filed a lien against your home for no reason. It's important for us all to know how we could avoid this situation.
Reply: You protect your self by getting a lien waiver as a condition of every progress payment.  The final lien waiver will have language in it confirming that all suppliers and workers have been paid.
Comment: Nobody believes your story. You're really going with the "check got lost in the mail" routine? And then blaming the contractor like it's his fault for not reminding you that you have to actually pay your bills... laughable
Comment: Most states don’t allow you to file a mechanics lien unless an invoice is at least 30 days past due. So let’s be honest - how late were you on payment?

If he had time to finish the work and for you to list it and get to the closing table I’m guessing at least 45 days.

That being said, I’m NAL, but I believe part of closing documents include you stating you’re not aware of any other liens/judgements on the property. If that’s the case you’d be committing fraud.
Comment: I assume there’s more to this, why would a contractor jump straight to putting a lien on your house if you were:

A. Paying them promptly and on time
B. Communicated with them the details of the payment
C. Communicated you were using funds from closing to pay him(likely the case)

I feel there’s many details left out here
Comment: Nobody is doing a lien unless it’s been awhile since you paid. How about you stop being a cheap ass and pay your contractors.
Comment: Talk to your title company.  The lien can be bonded, at a cost.   I never heard it done on a single family home.    Again check with your title company.  They may suggest you cancel payment on the check and bring the contractor a certified check in person in exchange for the lien waiver.  What is the amount on the lien? Does it match what’s on the check?  The title company will ask you.  Is there a disputed amount?  If there is, especially if it’s significant, that’s when you bond the lien.  Again, talk to your title company.  The title company may offer to put an exclusion on the title insurance.  But that doesn’t resolve what you owe to the contractor.  And the lien will still be attached to the house. It just lets you close and move in.  When you get the lien waiver it has to be filed and resolved at the town or county’s clerk office.  Do not let this slip!!!! When your kids go to sell the house…. Again talk to your title company.  Did I mention you need to talk to the title company?
Comment: This contractor seems like the only smart one here. You need to stop, blaming him and look at yourself in a mirror. And the right thing to do would’ve been to pay him on time, drive a check to him pay him in cash, whatever it takes next time to make sure he knows he’s not getting screwed without placing a lien on your property.

Yes, this will affect closing. I would notify the title company and instruct them to pay him the amount of the lien and put a stop payment on the original check.
Comment: Contact the closing attorney and title insurance co and have them bond the lein. They will simply withhold that amount from your proceeds at closing until the lein is resolved.
Comment: Everyone else has pointed out the obvious and a couple people have recommended solutions, but so far nobody has actually answered your what-if question, so here we go....

A) If they're smart, the title company will do one last check for liens, find the new lien, and refuse to close until the matter is resolved.

B) If they don't find the lien, the sale will go through. The county will still record the transaction. You'll get all the sale proceeds. Title will legally transfer. The lien will remain on the property. Sounds perfect, right? Wrong....

C) YOU still owe the contractor for the work they performed. If the amount is significant (and I assume it is, people don't file liens for small amounts) they will likely sue you for the outstanding amount, plus the cost to file the lien, plus the legal costs for suing you, plus interest, and you will certainly lose, because you in fact owe them money.

D) Title will be clouded--the Buyer won't be able to sell the property until the lien is removed. They will almost certainly sue you, and if they do you will certainly lose, because among other things the paperwork you've signed certainly includes a clause that you warrant that the property they are receiving at closing is free and clear of liens.

You will be better off if the title company finds the lien. If they don't, you should tell them about it so they can set aside the funds from the sale proceeds. This is definitely one of those scenarios in life where you might have yourself $10k today but cost yourself $25k tomorrow.

Be smart. Do the right thing. Get this taken care of Monday.
Comment: Sounds like you should have straightened this out beforehand.
Comment: This is horrible. Pay your bills on time.
Comment: The dumb contractor is not so dumb. After the property is sold he has no recourse or leverage. You're the dumb one for waiting to pay him
Comment: Your payment got delayed by one day and he filed a lein?  Sounds like there’s missing info here.      
Comment: OP getting roasted in this thread.... Lol.

Came to give advice, stayed for the roasting
Comment: Planning to use net proceeds to pay the contractor? If you’re 30 days from work being completed, contractor saw home was listed and being sold I can’t blame him for putting a lien. Protecting himself in case you “skip town” and forget to pay again and the easiest way is the lien. Otherwise needs a judgment and to lien other assets you have which takes more time and money
Comment: Are you sure the lein wasn't already in place?  My dad was a plumbing contractor that owned his own business for a number of years.  If the job was over $X he would have a lein placed on the property prior to doing any work.  Once he was paid he lifted the lein.
Reply: You can place a lien, but it has no affect or is really valid until you go to court to perfect it.   And it would have no legal affect after the statutory lien perfecting timeframe.     The one instance being in OP’s case, going to closing during that time.
Comment: Cancel that check, and have that lien paid out at closing.
Comment: Have you tried simply paying your contractor on time?
Comment: We all know what happened here…
Comment: In my experience as a loan broker it depends on how swift your title company is but in general things should be ok....!

Title: Investing in a post office?
Description: I don't know anything beyond the basics of real estate investing, but ran across a rural building leased to the post office through 2028 that is for sale. Now assuming their rent is higher than my mortgage, is there any reason there isn't a safe investment? They're not likely to move, given the built in safes seen in the pictures of the property, and apparently i dont have to pay property taxes for whatever govt reason. I mess with stocks and have made a good bit off medical REIT's which I see as the same idea, a hospital isn't a tenant that's going to move every year or two.
Tag: Commercial Real Estate
Comment: Lease terms often have mandatory government standards. Basically, the government has more power than a usual tenant because it uses these form contracts that include mandatory capital improvements. They vary, but can incur substantial expenses.

The risk isn't that the post office will move two spots down the road; the risk is that the post office will consolidate. In some areas, 5 post offices consolidate into 2. You get the idea. Then, you are left holding property that is specifically built for a particular tenant - who do you rent it out to next? It will likely incur substantial repurposing costs. Further, the post office knows this and the regional contract negotiator will threaten to close various post offices and keep the location that has the lowest rent. What makes you so sure your rent will be lowest for the post office in the event of localized consolidation? Also, government leasing takes DEI into account. A competitor landlord might score more DEI points in the RFP.

Why wouldn't you pay property taxes? You're a private owner, you can get taxed by the local county. Now, if the post office owns the property, the county can't tax the feds due to the supremacy clause of the constitution. But your county can absolutely tax you as a private owner.
Reply: In triple net leases, the tenants pay for all expenses related to the building including property taxes, insurances, and maintenance
Comment: They are selling it for some reason. I can't see anything wrong with your reasoning. Post offices aren't moving around every year and I would think are almost 100% going to pay rent on time every month. So then why are they selling.

Is this post office moving in 2028 and they are trying to cash out before then? Is this place rapidly growing in population that they need a bigger building. Rapidly shrinking that they are going to get combined with another office?

Anecdotally, in my rural area we have had 1 post office close/move in the last 20 years that I can think of. So it does happen.
Reply: We had a rural post office building go up for sale... The only reason is that the owner died and the 2 kids couldn't agree on what to do, so the courts said "fine, sell it and split the $".

There's many reasons why someone might want to just cash out even if it's making money.
Comment: The postmaster General Louis DeJoy is trying to shrink the post office to make it profitable.

There is a publicly traded REIT that owns Post Offices called 'postal realty trust' you might read through their annual report and try to grasp the industry.
Reply: We had a post office about 15 years ago. It was in a low income area. They closed it as part of a ‘consolidation plan’. It was a busy location.

Comment: GSA leases are typically gross.  Expenses have gone up the last few years.  Especially insurance.     
Comment: Friends purchased 2 post office buildings.


The biggest question- should the post office close more
Offices, can you get a good tenant in the area?
Comment: NNN leases are extremely powerful and profitable. Federal government leases are gold standard; meaning you are going to get paid like clockwork and payment is guaranteed. Having said that, you really need to know why the seller is selling? I am really suspicious that the post office may be closing/moving and seller has some information. Try this; see if you can reach out to someone at the post office and ask them hey do you know if this post office is closing after 2028? Check with folks in local town if they heard anything..
Comment: IDK, you gotta remember the post office business is not exactly expanding. I live in a rural area, yet there are two post offices within about 3 miles of each other. I don’t think this will last long-term, I don’t think it should. I would think very strongly about what happens in 2028 when the post office moves out, and assume that’s going to happen, i.e. the worst case scenario, can you refill the space at a decent rate to continue a positive rate of return?
Comment: Send me the address I might be interested in it
Comment: We bought a building with a rural post office in it last year. No problems with the staff but their leasing agency is a complete PITA trying to negotiate what is essentially a 10 year lease. The old lease was too low because the landlord didn't care and now they won't even match inflation.
Comment: I almost bought a post office. They only sign a five year lease. Then it’s “ recommended “ that you use a certain commercial broker to negotiate the next five year lease. Of course they take a one month commission. In the end I found better opportunities
Comment: Invest in PsTL. It’s a REIT that owns US post office buildings.
Comment: I very vaguely am aware of the Delivering for America plan, which seeks to cut the number of post offices
Comment: Don't assume anything. If this location did nothing but print money why is the guy who's selling it selling it?

Best guarantee it stays open is if the area is represented by someone powerful in Congress, ideally on the relevant oversight Committees.

Title: Debating whether better to put house up for rent [US-VA]
Description: Looking for some advice from landlords with rental property, specifically sfh. I have a house currently listed for sale, but debating whether it would be better to keep as rental. Rental management company suggested I could get $3000 less 8% and one month rental fee. My mortgage on house is $2600 fixed 30 years 2.9 rate, bought 2020. What are some pros and cons and is it worth it if I only plan to have one rental property.     
Tag: Rent or Sell my House?
Comment: If rents are increasing, you could make this work. Do you want to stay in real estate or would you rather not be a landlord?

Will you be moving more than 100 miles from the house?

Assuming the house is worth around 350k and you have 10% equity…
Reply: I will be less than 25 miles away from the rental property and on the fence if I want to be in real estate/landlord. I wouldn't mind managing the rental myself which will save me a good amount in management fees.   
Comment: Self-management (even from afar) isn't super difficult, especially in a larger urban area (NOVA, Hampton Roads, RVA).  The commissions you're talking about (a month's rent for a tenant and a month per year for management) take you from positive cash flow to negative cash flow, so I'd be strongly biased against property management (especially that close).

All three of those markets you also get a lot of government employees/folks with relatively high paying and very safe jobs.

Create an ad on Zillow; run a couple Saturday open houses with it listed at the $3k recommended (maybe a little more - do your own due diligence looking at the nearby market) prospectively to see what you get.

Your rate's awesome; if you can cash flow (or make enough to not need to cash flow in the first couple years) I'd strongly consider it.
Reply: Thanks for the responses and I’ll look into Zillow to possibly self manage the rental.
Comment: Try finding a tenant through Zillow. Have firm requirements, do a credit check, and ask to tour their current rental. Essentially you want to see if they live like pigs, smoke in the house, or have animal urine in the house.
Comment: I rented my townhome and do the management myself. I made sure everything was in good working condition then rented it out slightly lower than market rates for long term tenants and they have been great! My lease has been for 15 months and they’ve renewed twice. Good luck!
Comment: Do it.  Calculate tax depreciation on owning the house.  If house is worth $400000 and land under it is worth (as an example) $200000 you can depreciate $200000/27.5 =$7272.73 per year on your taxes.  Enjoy!      
Comment: For $400/mo cashflow I’d just sell, unless you think it’s gonna appreciate like crazy, you’ll probably be in the red once you factor in insurance and taxes. That’s not even counting repairs that might come up.    
Reply: I'd guarantee someone moving out of his home and considering renting it is including insurance and taxes when he quotes us his mortgage payment; insurance should drop a bit when he takes it to a rental property policy.
Comment: $3000 8% monthly, and 1M rent? That’s highway robbery, particularly on a $400 projected cash flow….   

400*12=$4800
Less 12(3000*.08)=$2880
Less 1st months rent = $3000

So they make $5880 and you lose 1k before any repairs or maintenance?

Sounds like better off seller, OR if possible self manage.

Your only upside is equity gained, no cash flow, and at negative 1k+ maintenance each year that equity isn’t as sexy

Broken HVAC away from stressing out for years for no positive gain from where you’re at right now…

Just my 2 cents

Comment: Here in Florida, I would carry liability and quit paying for property if I was paid off. Doesn't cover anything, anyway.
Reply: Yes, I think my question may be a Florida only thing.

I am looking long term retirement plans and insurance at $600-$800 15 years ago is now $3,500+ and a constant bombardment of nonsense upgrades because insurance has us by the leash.

I have the money to pay off a few loans that are at 3%. Which ain’t worth it, but if I could drop the $3k insurance bill to $500.  Suddenly paying off loans makes sense.
